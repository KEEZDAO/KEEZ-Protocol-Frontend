# Keez Protocol

The power of KEEZ DAO unlocks the KEEZ Protocol. This platform allows individuals to create a DAO and distribute permissions to members. The permissions can enable members to vote, propose, delegate, add/revoke permissions, and access the vaults and multisig of the DAO. The mission of this protocol is to revolutionize DAO governance models and step away from traditional token gating.
